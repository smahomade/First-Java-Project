<b> My First Java Game (IntelliJ, Java, CityEngine40) </b>

Java game was my first gaming project made using CityEngine40 (City University's game engine) to keep it breif it is a 2D shooter game with 3 levels.

How To Open the Project

1. Download all files into one folder

3. Direct to src/com/Safee/Game.java and press "Run" on the top corner
4. Instructions on how to play should be on the ReadMeDoc
