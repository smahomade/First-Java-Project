My first Java game made in IntelliJ, using CityEngine40, City Universitys game engine
1. Download all files into one folder
2. Open the folder in Intellij (I've attempted to open it in VS Code and found no luck unfortunately)
3. Direct to src/com/Safee/Game.java and press "Run" on the top corner
4. Instructions on how to play should be on the Word Document
