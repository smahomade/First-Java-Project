## About
This was the First game that i created in City University bootcampe using Java, IntelliJ and the Universitys GameEngine (CityEngine40). This game is a 2D shooter zombie game, on each side of the screen zombies spawn at a specific time and you get a gun with endless bullets and projectiles trying to get to the end. 

## How To Open the Project
1. Download all files into one folder
2. Open the folder in Intellij (I've attempted to open it in VS Code and found no luck unfortunately)
3. Direct to src/com/Safee/Game.java and press "Run" on the top corner
4. Instructions on how to play should be on the ReadMeDoc
